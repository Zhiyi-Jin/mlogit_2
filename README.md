### Multinomial Logistic Regression Problems
                   
General Social Survey data (gss_sm), contained in the ``socviz`` package is used in this project. You can learn more about the variables in this data set at the GSS website https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/. Specifically, there are two parts of the project:

**Part 1: A multinomial model of intergenerational mobility**                

Parental education can be a good predictor of children’s educational achievement. Children may have better educational attainment if their parents have higher levels of education degrees. Parents with excellent educational backgrounds are more likely to have a high level of wages to provide their children with good educational opportunities. Moreover, parents are role models to their children. 

However, will there be significant differences in the influence of father’s or mother’s schooling on their children’s educational attainment? The first part of the project will explore this question.

**Part 2: The separation problem**       

In the second part, I estimate models that predict the number of sexual partners people have had in the last year as a function of marital status and religion in the United States. The diagnose of potential separation problems are specifically discussed.
